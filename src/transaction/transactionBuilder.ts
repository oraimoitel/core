/**
 * Transaction Builder with Undo/Redo History (#139)
 *
 * `createTransactionBuilder()` returns a builder whose operations are stored
 * in an immutable history stack inside a closure.  Each call to `addOperation`
 * appends to the stack; `undo()` pops the last operation and moves it onto a
 * redo stack; `redo()` moves the next operation back onto the main stack.
 *
 * Committing the builder (via `getOperations`) always reflects the current
 * state of the history — it never includes undone operations.

 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const builder = createTransactionBuilder();
 *
 * builder
 *   .addOperation({ type: "payment", params: { destination: "GDEST...", amount: "10" } })
 *   .addOperation({ type: "trustline", params: { assetCode: "USDC" } });
 *
 * builder.undo();           // removes "trustline"
 * builder.redo();           // re-adds "trustline"
 * builder.getOperations();  // [payment, trustline]
 * ```
